I want to create a UI for a DevDocs Folder. I want there to be a nav bar at the top and a side bar on the left.

Three tabs for the main area: Project Scope, User Journies, and Mental Snapshots

Just make them empty pages with the left nav column as well. 

Before we go to the nav bar and side bar, we should have a project list and the option to create a new project, or delete a proejct.
