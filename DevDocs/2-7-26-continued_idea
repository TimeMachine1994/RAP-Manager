Ok so this is what I'm thinking. Project scope an user journeys and metnal snapshot are all based off of markdown ifles

Inside porject scope we use 3 markdowns, called initial idea, closest competitor features, then a wbs of the mvp of our project.

User journyes allow us to create a markdown file for each user journey. eadch journey is an initial idea, 
with the goal to create a fleshed out wbs of it, then a journal of the wbs.

each markdown can show up as a card.

the amrkdowns will be generated by our ai ide, and we just need to i  guess poll for the files when they appear.

then mental snapshots are when we are working on the project and mus tleave, it we should create a file explainig what we did and what we need to know going forward.

I almost want this to be a series of prompts like i just describes to fullfill this iterative code process, where the webfsite we awr emaking reminds us what to do and shows us and lets us see it easily. but it reads not writes.

further more, maybe we can have it make makrdowns with certain titles or in a certgain schema or even db idk so we cna differentiate what is generated for this based on the prompts in the website. , so we cna make changfes but our new prompt getsl linked from the ide...
