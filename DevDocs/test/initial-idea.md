# RAP Manager — Initial Idea

## Core Concept

RAP Manager (Read-only Artifact & Prompt Manager) is a read-only development documentation dashboard built with SvelteKit. It surfaces markdown files generated by AI IDEs, organizing them into a structured, browsable interface that guides developers through an iterative build process.

## Problem Being Solved

When using AI-powered IDEs (Windsurf/Cascade, Cursor, Copilot), developers generate large amounts of documentation, plans, and context — but it all lives as scattered files with no structure. There's no single place to:

- See the big picture of a project's scope, journeys, and progress
- Know what to generate next in the iterative process
- Capture and retrieve mental context when switching between sessions
- Guide the AI IDE with the right prompts at the right time

## Target Users

- **Solo developers** using AI IDEs who want structured project management without leaving their workflow
- **Small teams** that need a shared read-only dashboard to track AI-generated documentation
- **Anyone** who follows an iterative idea → WBS → implementation → journal cycle

## High-Level Goals

1. **Read-only by design** — The website never writes files; the AI IDE is the sole author
2. **Markdown-native** — All content is stored as `.md` files with YAML frontmatter for categorization
3. **Guided prompts** — Empty card slots show copy-pasteable prompts so you always know what to generate next
4. **Three-pillar organization** — Project Scope, User Journeys, and Mental Snapshots
5. **Smart Import** — One mega-prompt bootstraps all documentation for an existing project

## Key Differentiators

- **Not a writing tool** — Unlike Notion or Obsidian, RAP Manager is purely a reader/organizer
- **IDE-first workflow** — Content is generated where you code, viewed where you manage
- **Convention over configuration** — Frontmatter schema + folder conventions, no complex setup
- **Prompt-driven iteration** — The dashboard itself is a series of prompts guiding your development process

## Tech Stack (from codebase)

- **SvelteKit** (v2) with **Svelte 5** (runes: `$state`, `$derived`, `$props`)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling
- **Drizzle ORM** with SQLite (`local.db`) for project metadata
- **better-auth** for authentication (GitHub/Google OAuth ready)
- **gray-matter** for frontmatter parsing, **marked** for markdown→HTML rendering
- **Vite 7** dev server
